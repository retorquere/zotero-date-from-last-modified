zotero-date-from-last-modified
=================

Install by downloading the [latest version](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-date-from-last-modified/releases/latest)

If the date field is not filled, and the URL field is, fill the date from URL last-modified automatically after an item changes.

# Selective date-filling

You can specify which item types get empty dates filled by this
plugin by adding a comma-separated list of item types in the hidden
preference `extensions.zotero.date-from-last-modified.itemtypes`.
If it's empty, all item types are used. You get to the hidden
preferences by selecting the Advanced pane of the Zotero preferences
and click "Config Editor".  Enter "date-from-last-modified" into
the Filter field at the top of the list that comes up. Please don't
change any of the other hidden preferences. It's easy to break stuff
here.

The item types Zotero knows about are:

- annotation
- artwork
- audioRecording
- bill
- blogPost
- book
- bookSection
- case

# Support - read carefully

My time is extremely limited for a number of very great reasons (you shall have to trust me on this). Because of this, I
cannot accept bug reports
or support requests on anything but the latest version. If you submit an issue report,
please include the version that you are on. By the time I get to your issue, the latest version might have bumped up
already, and you
will have to upgrade (you might have auto-upgraded already however) and re-verify that your issue still exists.
Apologies for the inconvenience, but such
are the breaks.
